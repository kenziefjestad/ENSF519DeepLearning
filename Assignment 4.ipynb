    "2. To improve the results we could train the model for more epochs which would allow the loss to continue to decrease. Another thing we could do is increase model complexity by adding more LSTM layers or increasing the hidden size.\n",
    "3. Using a simple RNN would cause problems with vanishing and exploding gradients. Using LSTM or GRU would allow the model to capture longer patterns.\n",
    "4. Doing one-hot encoding for each word would create vectors that are very big that do not contain much information. Using embeddings creates low dimensional vectors where similar words will have similar representations.\n",
    "5. Switching to character level input would drastically increase the training time dramatically since the sequences would be much longer. The performance would more likely decrease since the current model parameters would unlikely be able to capture meaningful patterns.\n",
    "6. Having low vocabulary would decrease training time but likely underfit. A high vocabulary would increase the training time and tend to overfit."

I would have liked more experience with the data processing side of things so that I could have understood better what it means to clean data and represent it in the best way for the specific model. Maybe this will be covered in later assignments but it felt a bit rushed in this one."
